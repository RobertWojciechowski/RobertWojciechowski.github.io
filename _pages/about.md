I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF) and Barcelona School of Economics (BSE). My  advisors are [Prof. Christian Brownlees](https://ctbrownlees.github.io/) and [Prof. Andrea Caggese](https://andreacaggese.weebly.com/). 

My research lies at the intersection of econometrics and macroeconomics. I work on developing and applying causal econometrics tools to macroeconomics. I specialize in quantile regressions, local projections, and difference-in-differences. I study a broad range of macroeconomic topics from growth-at-risk to firm dynamics.
