I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF) and Barcelona School of Economics (BSE). My  advisors are [Prof. Christian Brownlees](https://ctbrownlees.github.io/) and [Prof. Andrea Caggese](https://andreacaggese.weebly.com/). 

My research lies at the intersection of econometrics and macroeconomics, with a focus on developing and applying
causal inference methods to macroeconomic questions. I specialise in the potential outcomes framework, quantile
regression, local projections, and difference-in-differences. My work explores topics such as growth-at-risk, firm
dynamics, and public policy evaluation.
